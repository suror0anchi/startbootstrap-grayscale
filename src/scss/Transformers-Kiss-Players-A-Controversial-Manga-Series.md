The first chapter of Transformers Kiss Players introduces the main characters and the setting of the series. The year is 2006, and Earth has been invaded by Legion, a horde of mutated creatures that were created by the impact of Galvatron's Unicron-empowered cells. The only way to stop them is by using ParasiTech, a technology that allows humans to fuse with Transformers by kissing them.
 
The protagonist is Atari Hitotonari, a 14-year-old girl who lost her parents in a Legion attack. She is rescued by Optimus Prime, the leader of the Autobots, who kisses her and fuses with her. She then joins the Earth Defense Command (EDC), a military organization that employs Kiss Players to fight against Legion. She also meets Shaoshao Li and Marissa Faireborn, two other Kiss Players who fuse with Hot Rod and Thundercracker respectively.
 
The first chapter also introduces the main villains of the series: Autorooper, a rogue Autrooper who can control other Autroopers and Legion; and Glit, a mysterious figure who seems to be behind Autorooper's actions. The chapter ends with a cliffhanger, as Atari and Optimus Prime are attacked by Autorooper and his army.
  
The second chapter of Transformers Kiss Players continues the battle between Atari and Optimus Prime against Autorooper and his forces. Atari learns that she can use her voice to activate Optimus Prime's weapons and abilities, such as his axe and his matrix. She also learns that she can communicate with Optimus Prime telepathically, and that he cares for her deeply. However, she also feels a strange pain in her chest whenever she kisses him.
 
Meanwhile, Shaoshao and Marissa are sent to investigate a Legion outbreak in Tokyo. They encounter a giant squid-like Legion that attacks them. Shaoshao uses her martial arts skills to fight it, while Marissa uses her military training to shoot it. They manage to defeat it with the help of their Transformers partners, but not without some damage and injuries.
 
The second chapter also reveals some backstory about the origin of ParasiTech and Legion. It is explained that Galvatron's cells were scattered across the planet when he crashed into Earth in 2005, after being defeated by Rodimus Prime. His cells infected various life forms and objects, creating Legion. However, some humans who were exposed to his cells gained the ability to fuse with Transformers by kissing them. These humans were recruited by the EDC as Kiss Players, and given Autroopers as their partners.
